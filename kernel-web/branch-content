                    <p>To install <a href="https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Kernel:/@repo@">prebuilt kernel</a> from this branch run</p>
                    <pre>
zypper ar -f https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Kernel:/@repo@/standard \

                    <p>Please note: The packages are built for the distribution
                    they are targetting. In case of the vanilla and linux-next
                    branches, this is the latest released openSUSE version.
                    While the packages should work fine on fine on a
                    distribution that is slightly newer or slightly older,
                    installing ancient kernels on the latest distributions is
                    asking for trouble. Same goes for the opposite case, e.g.
                    installing the Factory kernel on SLES 9.</p>
                    <h2>kernel-source.git</h2>
<p>There are two SUSE Kernel repositories. Development happens in the
<a href="https://github.com/@open@SUSE/kernel-source/tree/@branch@">kernel-source</a>
git repository. This tree is a quile-like series of patches against the
upstream kernel, plus spec files and various scripts. You can clone it with
</p>

<pre>git clone https://github.com/@open@SUSE/kernel-source -b @branch@</pre>
<h2>kernel.git</h2>
<p> If you just want to hack on the sources and do not need to package the
kernel, use the <a href="https://github.com/@open@SUSE/kernel/tree/@branch@">kernel</a>
git repository. This one has the same layout as the upstream kernel. Clone
command: </p>

<pre>git clone https://github.com/@open@SUSE/kernel -b @branch@</pre>
